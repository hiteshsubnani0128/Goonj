<h2>Goonj - Material management during Disaster<br></h2>

<b>We Made this Project at Smart India Hackathon 2k19 - Grand Final for Goonj.org </b> <br>

<h2>Problem Statment</h2>
<p>One of the initiative of Goonj is to work with people and for people in the regions devastated by any sort of disasters - floods, earthquake, landslides, cloud burst, drought, winters, cyclones, Tsunami etc. Our involvement is in- 
Providing relief material in the initial phase.
Providing rehabilitation material to those whose livelihood is severed for example giving sewing kit (including machine) to a tailor to restart the livelihood, basic utensils and raw material to someone whose eatery is destroyed and likewise. Our centers all over India, run collection drives for material required as per the type of disaster, regional and local culture. Material need, availability, movement, receipt to the last person becomes quite tedious to maintain. Give us a SOLUTION - to maintain and know the exact material available at each center, what has been dispatched against the demand, record/tally material reached the last location vis-a-vis the dispatch. Account for the material handed over for relief, development activities to the last person at the disaster location. Goonj team in remotest of areas should be able to use the application on the hand held device in online or offline mode. Drill down Dashboards to bring in efficiently in operations. So that Goonj team Pan India is updated situation across all Goonj centers.</p>

<h2>Our Approach :</h2>
<p>The aim of the problem is to maintain the flow of relief material between diff centers to the disaster location. To solve this problem we will build a web app that will help us know the availability of materials at diff centers, tally the material reaching the disaster location after it’s dispatch and confirmation of the materials reached. The key features of the web app include:
  <ul>
    <li>Dashboard</li>
    <li>Record Page</li>
    <li>Demand Page</li>
    <li>Dispatched Page</li>
</p>
<b>Dashboard:</b> This will connect all fundamental elements of the application. This will help easy user access
<br><b>Records Page:</b> This page will hold the details of the materials available at diff centers. Stock details can be
added as well, this can be done by authorized members only. Other users can only view the records.
<br><b>Demand Page:</b> This page will provide a form for the user to demand for the materials based on
requirements. Once the demand is accepted successfully a receipt will be generated for future use.
<br><b>Dispatched page:</b> This page will maintain various orders that has been dispatched from the center. This
page can be accessed by center’s stock manager or other authorized members only.
When a demand is raised by the user a notification to the stock manager’s account will be sent both on its
app as well as email account. In response he will be sending the acknowledgment of the order to user
through app notification and on registered email & mobile no as well.
Tracking system would be provided so that user can know the status of its order that whether the
materials are dispatched or not, estimated time to reach and whether materials are out for delivery.
<br><b><u>Offline capabilities:</b></u> Users can use this application both online and offline mode. For this we will be storing
the necessary data locally and sync them with the database whenever user gets online. While filing a
demand request if the user if offline, user will also be asked to send the request details via mobile sms
through his registered mobile no so that his order can be acknowledged immediately.
This application is to be used by goonj members only. User must be a member of goonj organization else
access would be denied.
